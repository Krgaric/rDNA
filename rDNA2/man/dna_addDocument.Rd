}
\details{
The \code{dna_addDocument} function can add new documents to an existing DNA
database. The user supplies a \link{dna_connection} object as well as various
details about the document, for example the title, text, date etc. The date
can be supplied either as a \link{POSIXct} object or as an integer value
containing millisecond since 1970-01-01. The document ID will be
automatically generated and can be returned if \code{returnID} is set to
\code{TRUE}.
