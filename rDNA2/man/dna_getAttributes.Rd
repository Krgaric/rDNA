\title{Retrieve a dataframe with attributes from a DNA connection.}
\usage{
dna_getAttributes(
  connection,
  statementType = 1,
  variable = "organization",
  values = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{A \code{dna_connection} object created by the
\code{dna_connection} function.}

\item{statementType}{The ID of the statement type (as an integer) or the name
of the statement type (as a character object) in which the variable is
defined.}

\item{variable}{The name of the variable for which attribute data should be
retrieved, for example \code{"organization"} or \code{"concept"}.}

\item{values}{An optional character vector of entries to which the dataframe
should be limited. If all values and attributes should be retrieved for a
given variable, this can be \code{NULL} or a character vector of length 0.}
}
\description{
Attributes are metadata for the values saved in a variable. For example, an
organization can be associated with a certain color or type. This function
serves to retrieve these attributes for the values of a given variable from
DNA as a dataframe. The user supplies a DNA connection and specifies the
variable for which the attributes should be extracted as well as the
statement type in which the variable is defined (by statement type ID).
Optionally, a vector of values for which the attributes should be extracted
can be specified; this limits the vector to the values specified. The
resulting dataframe contains an additional column for the frequency with
which the respective value is used in statements across the database.
