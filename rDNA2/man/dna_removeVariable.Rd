\title{Add a new variable to a statement type in the database}
\usage{
dna_removeVariable(
  connection,
  statementType = 1,
  variable,
  simulate = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{A \code{dna_connection} object created by the
\code{dna_connection} function.}

\item{statementType}{The statement type from which variable should be
deleted. The statement type can be supplied as an integer ID or character
string, for example \code{1} or \code{"DNA Statement"}.}

\item{variable}{The name of the variable as a character object.}

\item{simulate}{Should the changes only be simulated instead of actually
applied to the DNA connection and the SQL database? This can help to
plan more complex recode operations.}

\item{verbose}{Print details about the recode operations?}
}
