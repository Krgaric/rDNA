\arguments{
\item{dna_scale}{A \code{dna_scale} object.}

\item{variable}{Variable to be plotted.}

\item{dimensions}{Number of dimensions to be plotted. Valid values are
\code{1} and \code{2} for a one- or two-dimensional plot, and \code{2.1}
or \code{2.2} for the first or second dimension of a two-dimensional
scaling.}

\item{hpd}{A numeric scalar specifying the size of the Highest Posterior
Density intervals (HPD). Defaults to \code{0.95}. \code{NULL} turns off
HPDs.}

\item{label}{Logical. Should labels be plotted? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{label_size, point_size}{Label and point size in pts.}

\item{label_colors, point_colors, hpd_colors}{Colors for the labels, points
and Highest Posterior Densities of the plot. \code{TRUE} colors the
variables according to the attributes in the object and \code{FALSE} sets
colors to black. You can also provide customized colors. Possible
options are either providing a single character vector (if you wish to
color a plot element in only one color), or a character or numeric vector
or data frame of at least the same length as values to be plotted. If you
use a data frame, please provide one column named \code{"names"} that
indicates the names of the values and one column named \code{"colors"}
that specifies the value colors. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{hpd_lwd}{Highest Posterior Density interval linewidth in pts.}

\item{intercept_lwd}{Linewidth of the intercept (a vertical bar indicating
zero) in pts.}

\item{intercept_color}{Color for the intercept.}

\item{intercept_lty}{A character vector providing the linetype of the
intercept. Valid values are \code{"solid"}, \code{"dashed"},
\code{"dotted"}, \code{"twodash"}, \code{"dotdash"}, \code{"longdash"} or
\code{"blank"}. Defaults to \code{"dashed"}. \code{"blank"} turns off
intercept.}

\item{intercept_alpha}{A numeric value indicating the alpha level of the
intercept.}

\item{facet}{A character vector specifying which attribute of the variable
should be used for the facet plot. Valid values are \code{"type"},
\code{"alias"} or \code{"notes"}.}

\item{truncate}{Sets the number of characters to which labels should be
truncated.}

\item{x_axis_label, y_axis_label}{A character vector specifying the x and y
axis label name(s).}

\item{exclude_min}{A numeric value reducing the plot to actors/concepts
with a minimum frequency of statements.}

\item{exclude}{A character vector to exclude actors/concepts from the plot.}

\description{
Plots ideological ideal points with the results of the MCMC scaling
performed in the \code{dna_scale} functions.
}
\details{
This function is a convenience wrapper for the \code{ggplot2} package to
plot ideological ideal points from \code{dna_scale} objects. Two different
variables can be plotted:

Firstly, you can plot the ideological ideal points of subjects (e.g.,
\code{"organizations"}) which you have provided in \code{variable1} of the
\code{dna_scale} functions. The ideal point, which is the mean value of the
MCMC sample parameters, serves as the ideological position of an actor in an
e.g., ideological or policy dimension.

Secondly, you can plot the item discrimination parameter of the variable
provided in \code{variable2} of the \code{dna_scale} functions (e.g.,
\code{"concepts"}). The item discrimination parameter indicates how
good for example a specific \code{"concept"} separates actors in the
ideological space.

Plotting all actors or concepts can create chaotic plots, you can, therefore,
limit the plot by including only the most active actors or most prominent
concepts with \code{exclude_min}. Specific entries can be excluded with the
\code{exclude} argument. Furthermore, the plot can be split into several
facets according to the attributes of the variables.
