\title{Removes a document from the database}
\usage{
dna_removeDocument(
  connection,
  id,
  removeStatements = FALSE,
  simulate = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{A \code{dna_connection} object created by the
\link{dna_connection} function.}

\item{id}{An integer value denoting the ID of the document to be removed. The
\link{dna_getDocuments} function can be used to look up IDs.}

\item{removeStatements}{The document given by \code{id} may contain
statements. If \code{removeStatements = TRUE} is set, these statements
are removed along with the respective document. If
\code{removeStatements = FALSE} is set, the statements are not deleted,
the document is kept as well, and a message is printed.}

\item{simulate}{Should the changes only be simulated instead of actually
applied to the DNA connection and the SQL database? This can help to
plan more complex recode operations.}

\item{verbose}{Print details on whether the document could be removed?}
}
\description{
Removes a document from the database based on its ID.
}
\details{
The user provides a connection object and the ID of an existing document in
the DNA database, and this document is removed both from memory and from the
SQL database, possibly including any statements contained in the document.
